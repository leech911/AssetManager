what does transfer button do?

transfer lets user move tagged item from one location to another
should link to table that has tagged asset listed
both disposal and transfer need the same table to display known assets
should use the same query for both tables, but; both tables will use seperate logic

asset tag (tblTaggedAssets.gesaTag)
name (tblASsetDesc.name)
make (tblAssetDesc.make
model (tblAssetDesc.model)
last transfer date (tblTaggedAssets.lastModified)
location name (tblLocations.locName)
department (tblTaggedAssets.department) 

tables: tblTaggedAssets
	tblAssetDesc
	tblLocations
